# The beginnings of an Akai Fire tool for Renoise

I really wanted to complete this project to use the akai fire as my main controller for renoise but I lack the time. This project is at a working state. I may break it up into modules such as Akai fire sysex stuff, renoise externs, and whatever else and release those independently. I would love if someone wanted to continue this project.

Anyways :)
